# One day in the beach. A demo game project.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhaserEditor2D/one-day-in-the-beach-demo-button-components/media/media/banner.png)

This is a demo [Phaser Editor 2D](https://phasereditor2d.com) project to show how to create buttons with different behaviors.
The behaviors are coded as [User Components](https://help.phasereditor2d.com/v3/scene-editor/user-components.html) so no-coding level designers can create the scenes with the drag-and-drop [Scene Editor](https://help.phasereditor2d.com/v3/scene-editor/index.html).

## Install

Just clone this repo in the [Phaser Editor 2D workspace](https://help.phasereditor2d.com/v3/workbench/projects.html), and open it.

If you find any problem or suggestion, please open an issue in this project.

* Does not load the `GameSounds.js` and `EventComponent.js` in the `index.html` file. Now they are loaded in the Asset Pack file using the new Scripts file type.

* Changes the type of some properties of components:
    * The **Checkbox** component uses a Texture Config type.
    * The **StartSceneOnClick** uses an Asset Key type.

### v1.0.0 - Aug 17, 2020
